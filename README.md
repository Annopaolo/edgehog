# Edgehog

Edgehog is an Open Source software focused on the management of the whole life-cycle of IoT devices,
written in [Elixir](https://github.com/elixir-lang/elixir). It is based on
[Astarte](https://github.com/astarte-platform/astarte), the Open Source IoT platform.

It packs in convenient features such as OTA updates, device status information management,
geolocation and everything you need for IoT fleet management.

# Where do I find binaries?

Edgehog is designed from the ground up to be run in containers, with
[Kubernetes](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes) as a first-class citizen when it comes to
deployment. Edgehog's images can be found at
[Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/edgehogdevicemanager).
